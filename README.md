# Overview
This Jupyter Notebook implements the `K-Means` clustering algorithm for educational purposes.
The implementation is part of an assignment where we chose to investigate how the K-Means clustering algorithm work.
<br>
<br>
The notebook provides a class, KMeans, that enables users to perform clustering on datasets.
The class includes methods for calculating distances between points and centroids, 
performing the clustering process, and visualizing the results.
<br>
<br>
The code is thoroughly commented to explain what the different parts of the code does.
The K-Means class will show plots on each iteration so you can visualize the clustering process.
<br>
<br>
The notebook has an example with some generated random data.

## Dependencies
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

## Credits
The implementation is based on a youtube tutorial created by [NeuralNine](https://youtu.be/5w5iUbTlpMQ?si=LzfyxOvTfaw15tlo).
